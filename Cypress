Cypress automatically wait for commands and assertion before moving on
For example->Hidden elements(if some popup box comes above a checkbox so checkbox will be hidden)
Ability to test edge testcases by mocking the server response
Cypress take snapshot when the test are run,we can hover over each command in the command log to see exactly what happen at each step
Cypress is build on node js and comes packaged as an npm module
Cypress engine directly operates inside the engine there is no proxy server between it.In selenium we have chromedriver
Cypress intelligently know that there is some loading icon in browser and it automatically wait because it is seating on top of the browser and it keep listening to the DOM
Using cypress we can do unit,integrating and E2E testing
Browser supports-chrome,firefox,electron(lightversion of chrome)
NPM install(Node package manager)this is the place where whoever develop software which is javasvript based they host their packages
If you want to create package.json file give command-> npm -i init
Install cypress -npm install cypress --save-dev
After doing nom install->node-modules and package-lock.json is created
Initially when cypress started they told us to create a folder under Cypress named as integration and write all the code there
Any test case here is called spec file
How the cypress know where the file is been saved->So inside cypress.config.js file we can define
specPattern:'cypress/Integration/examples/*.js'
Scan and find all file which end with js
Mocha or jasmine are 2 framework which is available for javascript
Cypress has a knowledge of automating browser but we have to folow some testing standard to write test cases to make it runnable
