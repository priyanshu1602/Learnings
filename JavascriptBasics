**Naming convention**
variables cannot start with numbers
variables name follow camelCase
variable name only contain numbers,dollar,letters,underscore signs
error may occour if we use reserved javascript keywords.For eg-new,function
variable starting with uppercase will be used in OOPS
variable which are all in UPPERCASE are fixed or constant.For eg=PI=3.14
naming of variable should be proper,by seeing that name one can recorgnize what value is given

DataType-
In javascript can be primitive or object
if value is not object then only it is primitive
object->
let me={
       name:'jonus'
};

primitive->
let firstName=jonus;

total 7 primitive data types

console.log(2**3)->it means 2 to the power of 3->>>exponential operator

To concatenate we use "+" operator

let keywords can be changed in future
const keywords remains same,value cannot be changed(if we reassign we get an error)->immutable variables,example birthyear
we cannot declare empty const variable->for ex-const job(we get error)
for clean code we always use const,if you are sure that the variable is going to change in future then only use let
its a good practise to have very less changes in variables because it will introduce potential to  create bugs
Var is a old way of declaring variables,its just like let
difference between var and let

Its not mandatory to declare variables but it is not a good practise because it does not create a variable in current scope instead it will create a property in global object
